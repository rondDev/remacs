This repo serves as my own spin-off from [Rmcs Emacs](https://github.com/rmcsemacs/rmcsemacs).  

It is not intended to be a community solution, so it might not serve the purpose you need.
If you need a community supported and stable solution use [Rmcs](https://github.com/rmcsemacs/rmcsemacs) instead.
The intention behind this is to have my own private "fork" of Rmcs that diverges into my own thing.  

The motivation behind this was finding myself looking at how Rmcs initializes and all the optimizations it does,
I am sure I wouldn't be able to write something so good with the experience I currently have with emacs and elisp.
