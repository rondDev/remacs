- Eldoc will display the values of variables next to its documentation.
- ~elisp-demos~ was modified to display API demos for Rmcs's standard library
  (in [[file:../../../docs/api.org][docs/api.org]]).
- This module extends imenu support for Rmcs's API (e.g. ~package!~,
  ~use-package~, ~after!~)
- Flycheck has been configured to tone down the false positives when you are
  editing your Emacs or Rmcs config.
