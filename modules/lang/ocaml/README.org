* Description :unfold:
This module adds [[https://ocaml.org/][OCaml]] support to Doom Emacs, powered by [[rmcs-package:tuareg-mode]].

- Code completion, documentation look-up, code navigation and refactoring
  ([[rmcs-package:merlin]])
- Type, documentation and function argument display on idle ([[rmcs-package:merlin-eldoc]])
- REPL ([[rmcs-package:utop]])
- Syntax-checking ([[rmcs-package:merlin]] with [[rmcs-package:flycheck-ocaml]])
- Auto-indentation ([[rmcs-package:ocp-indent]])
- Code formatting ([[rmcs-package:ocamlformat]])
- Dune file format ([[rmcs-package:dune]])

** Maintainers
*This module needs a maintainer.* [[rmcs-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +lsp ::
  Enable LSP support for ~tuareg-mode~. Requires [[rmcs-module::tools lsp]] and a langserver
  (supports [[https://github.com/freebroccolo/ocaml-language-server][ocaml-language-server]]).
- +tree-sitter ::
  Leverages tree-sitter for better syntax highlighting and structural text
  editing. Requires [[rmcs-module::tools tree-sitter]].

** Packages
- [[rmcs-package:dune]]
- [[rmcs-package:ocamlformat]] if [[rmcs-module::editor format]]
- [[rmcs-package:ocp-indent]]
- [[rmcs-package:tuareg]]
- [[rmcs-package:utop]] if [[rmcs-module::tools eval]]
- unless [[rmcs-module:+lsp]]
  - [[rmcs-package:flycheck-ocaml]] if [[rmcs-module::checkers syntax]]
  - [[rmcs-package:merlin]]
  - [[rmcs-package:merlin-company]]
  - [[rmcs-package:merlin-eldoc]]

** Hacks
- ~set-ligatures!~ is called with the full tuareg prettify symbol list, this can
  cause columns to change as certain keywords are shortened (e.g. =fun= becomes
  \lambda).
- ~tuareg-opam-update-env~ is called the first time [[rmcs-package:tuareg]] is loaded

- The following files should have syntax highlighting support: ~.ml{i,p,y,}~,
  ~.eliom{i,}~, ~jbuild~, ~dune~, ~opam~
- ~merlin-mode~ is activated whenever a =.merlin= file is found (including in a
  parent directory) and =ocamlmerlin= executable is present
- Line-based auto-indentation is provided by =ocp-indent=, if it is available.

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[rmcs-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

- If [[rmcs-module::completion company]] is enabled then autocomplete is provided by [[rmcs-package:merlin]]
- When [[rmcs-module::checkers syntax]] is enabled then [[rmcs-package:flycheck-ocaml]] is activated to do
  on-the-fly syntax/type checking via [[rmcs-package:merlin]], otherwise this is only done when
  the file is saved.
- Spell checking is activated in comments if [[rmcs-module::checkers spell]] is active
- A REPL is provided if [[rmcs-package:utop]] is installed and [[rmcs-module::tools eval]] is active
- If [[rmcs-module::editor format]] is enabled, the =ocamlformat= executable is available and
  there is an =.ocamlformat= file present then ~format-all-buffer~ is bound to
  =ocamlformat=, otherwise to =ocp-indent=
- If [[rmcs-module::editor multiple-cursors]] is enabled then identifiers can be refactored with
  [[kbd:][v R]] and multiple cursors (this correctly matches identifier occurrences
  according to scope, it is not purely a textual match)

Run ~$ rmcs sync~ to install all packages and ~$ rmcs doctor~ to diagnose
missing tools.
