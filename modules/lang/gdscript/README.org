#+begin_src sh
# On Windows
pip install gdtoolkit

# On MacOS and Linux

** LSP support
The language server support for GDScript is built into by lsp-mode. As long as
you have [[rmcs-module:+lsp]] and [[rmcs-module::tools lsp]] enabled, and Godot 3.2.1+ installed, it should work
out of the box.

Godot's language server is built into the game engine, so you need to open your
project in Godot ~3.2.1~ or above for the GDScript language server to be
available.
