* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~rmcs!~ block.]]

This module requires Lua 5.1+ for most of its capabilities and, optionally, the
fennel and moonscript transpilers. An LSP server is also required for LSP
support.

** Language Server Protocol servers
LSP server support depends on which flavor of the [[rmcs-module::tools lsp]] module you have
installed ([[rmcs-package:eglot]] or [[rmcs-package:lsp-mode]]).

*** LSP-mode
Three servers are supported, ordered from highest to lowest priority:
- [[https://github.com/EmmyLua/EmmyLua-LanguageServer][EmmyLua-LanguageServer]] :: Must be in
  =$EMACSDIR/.local/etc/lsp/EmmyLua-LS-all.jar=. See
  ~lsp-clients-emmy-lua-jar-path~ variable to change this.
- [[https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server][Sumneko language server]] (lua-language-server) :: Must be in
  =$EMACSDIR/.local/etc/lsp/lua-language-server/=. See
  ~lsp-clients-lua-language-server-bin~ variable to change this.
- [[https://github.com/Alloyed/lua-lsp][lua-lsp]] :: Must be available in =~/.luarocks/bin/lua-lsp=. See
  ~lsp-clients-lua-lsp-server-install-dir~ variable to change this.

[[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/lsp-emmy-lua/][LSP-mode documentation]] has more information about setting up the server and the
configuration variables correctly.

*** Eglot
Eglot currently only supports one of the above servers out of the box:
+ [[https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server][Sumneko language server]] (lua-language-server) :: Must be in
  =$EMACSDIR/.local/etc/lsp/lua-language-server/=. See ~+lua-lsp-dir~ variable
  to change this.

** Formatter

Formatting is handled using the [[rmcs-module::editor format]] module via [[https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua#installation][Stylua]].

- lua-lsp-dir :: This must be set when using [[rmcs-module:+lsp]] and using [[https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server][lua-language-server]].
  This controls where the repository has been cloned and built to finish the
  configuration of the server.
