#+title:    :lang rest
#+subtitle: Emacs as a REST client
#+created:  February 20, 2017
#+since:    2.0.0

* Description :unfold:
This module turns Emacs into a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer][REST]] client.

- Code-completion (~company-restclient~)
- Code evaluation
- Imenu support for ~restclient-mode~
- org-mode: babel support (~ob-restclient~)

#+begin_quote
 ðŸ’¡ ~restclient-mode~ is tremendously useful for automated or quick testing REST
    APIs. My workflow is to open an ~org-mode~ buffer, create a restclient
    source block and hack away. ~restclient-mode~ and ~company-restclient~ power
    this arcane wizardry.
