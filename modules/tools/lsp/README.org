* Description :unfold:
This module integrates [[https://langserver.org/][language servers]] into Rmcs Emacs. They provide features
you'd expect from IDEs, like code completion, realtime linting, language-aware
[[rmcs-package:imenu]]/[[rmcs-package:xref]] integration, jump-to-definition/references support, and more.

As of this writing, this is the state of LSP support in Rmcs Emacs:

** Maintainers
/This module has no dedicated maintainers./ [[rmcs-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +eglot ::
  Use [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/eglot.html][Eglot]] instead of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][LSP-mode]] to implement the LSP client in Emacs.
- +peek ::
  Use ~lsp-ui-peek~ when looking up definitions and references with
  functionality from the [[rmcs-module::tools lookup]] module.

** Packages
- [[rmcs-package:lsp-mode]]
- [[rmcs-package:lsp-ui]]
- [[rmcs-package:lsp-ivy]] ([[rmcs-module::completion ivy]])
- [[rmcs-package:helm-lsp]] ([[rmcs-module::completion helm]])
- [[rmcs-package:consult-lsp]] ([[rmcs-module::completion vertico]])
- [[rmcs-package:eglot]]

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~rmcs!~ block.]]

To get LSP working, you'll need to do three things:

1. Enable this module,
2. Install a language server appropriate for your targeted language(s).
3. Enable the [[rmcs-module:+lsp]] flag on the [[rmcs-module::lang]] modules you want to enable LSP support for.

Different languages will need different language servers, some of which [[rmcs-package:lsp-mode]]
will prompt you to auto-install, but [[rmcs-package:eglot]] will not.

A table that lists available language servers and how to install them can be
found [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/languages/][on the lsp-mode project README]]. The documentation of the module for your
targeted language will contain brief instructions as well.

For eglot users, a list of [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/blob/master/README.md#connecting-to-a-server][default servers supported is on Eglot's README]],
including instructions to register your own.

** LSP-powered project search
Without the [[rmcs-module:+eglot]] flag, and when [[rmcs-module::completion ivy]], [[rmcs-module::completion helm]] or
[[rmcs-module::completion vertico]] is active, LSP is used to search a symbol indexed by the LSP
server:
| Keybind | Description                         |
|---------+-------------------------------------|
| [[kbd:][SPC c j]] | Jump to symbol in current workspace |
| [[kbd:][SPC c J]] | Jump to symbol in any workspace     |

** Differences between eglot and lsp-mode
The two projects are large and actively developed, so without writing a novel,
it can only be compared in (very) broad strokes:

- [[rmcs-package:lsp-mode]] tends to be more featureful, beginner-friendly (e.g. offers to
  install servers for you and has more [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode][helpful documentation]]), and has a user
  experience that feels familiar to modern editors/IDEs, but at the cost of
  performance (at baseline) and complexity (it has more moving parts and
  reinvents a number of wheels to achieve a slicker UI, like ~lsp-ui-peek~,
  ~lsp-ui-sideline~, etc).

- [[rmcs-package:eglot]] has fewer bells and whistles: it relies on built-in Emacs functionality
  more (eldoc, xref, capf, project.el, etc), offers less pre-configuration for
  you, and is more performant than lsp-mode (again, at baseline). It also works
  with TRAMP out-of-the-box (lsp-mode needs some extra configuration).

#+begin_quote
 󰟶 I recommend beginners use lsp-mode. More experienced users may also opt to
    disable many of [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/][its inessential features]] to gain back some ground on
    performance and complexity costs.
#+end_quote

All that said, it's easy to switch between the two implementations by swapping
in/out the [[rmcs-module:+lsp]] or [[rmcs-module:+eglot]] flag when [[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][enabling this module]].

* TODO Configuration
#+begin_quote
 󱌣 /This module's configuration documentation is incomplete./ [[rmcs-contrib-module:][Complete it?]]
#+end_quote

** Turn off lsp-mode's intrusive features
Many users may not like how many UI elements that lsp-mode adds. They have [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/how-to-turn-off/][some
excellent documentation]] outlining what these features are called and how to turn
them off.

* Troubleshooting
[[rmcs-report:][Report an issue?]]

** My language server is not found
Check the entry in the [[../../../docs/faq.org][FAQ]] about "Rmcs can't find my executables/doesn't inherit
the correct ~PATH~"

** LSP/Eglot is not started automatically in my buffer
Make sure that you have enabled the [[rmcs-module:+lsp]] flag on the appropriate module(s) (in
your ~rmcs!~ block in =$RMCSDIR/init.el=):
#+begin_src diff
:lang
-python
+(python +lsp)
#+end_src

** LSP is slow
Follow [[https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/performance/#tuning][lsp-tuning-guide]] to further fine-tune LSP mode performance.
