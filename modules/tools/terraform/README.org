includes syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, and the ability to
run Terraform commands directly from Emacs.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~rmcs!~ block.]]

This module requires the ~terraform~ executable to be installed and in your
=$PATH=.

* Usage
** Syntax highlighting
Syntax highlighting is provided from ~terraform-mode~ and ~hcl-mode~.

** Code formatting
[[rmcs-module::tools terraform]] does not provide code formatting directly, but [[rmcs-module::editor format]]
works with Terraform files.

** Code navigation
Code navigation is supported through [[rmcs-package:imenu]] from [[rmcs-package:terraform-mode]].

** Code completion
Code completion of Terraform builtins is provided from [[rmcs-package:company-terraform]] and
generally works well despite being generated through a [[https://github.com/rafalcieslak/emacs-company-terraform/blob/master/company-terraform-data.el][static (outdated) file]].

[[rmcs-package:company-terraform]] also provides code completion of resources within your
project.

** Documentation
Documentation is accessible through the normal [[rmcs-package:company]] show documentation
functionality, thanks to [[rmcs-package:company-terraform]].

** Executing Terraform commands
[[rmcs-module::tools terraform]] provides commands under [[kbd:][<localleader>]] to run the most common
Terraform operations:
| key             | description              |
|-----------------+--------------------------|
| [[kbd:][<localleader> i]] | Runs ~$ terraform init~  |
| [[kbd:][<localleader> p]] | Runs ~$ terraform plan~  |
| [[kbd:][<localleader> a]] | Runs ~$ terraform apply~ |
