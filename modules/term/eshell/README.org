* Description :unfold:
This module provides additional features for the built-in [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eshell.html][Emacs Shell]]

The Emacs Shell or [[rmcs-package:eshell]] is a shell-like command interpreter implemented in
Emacs Lisp. It is an alternative to traditional shells such as =bash=, =zsh=,
=fish=, etc. that is built into Emacs and entirely cross-platform.

** Packages

  - [[rmcs-package:fish-completion]]
  - [[rmcs-package:bash-completion]]

** Hacks
- Even with ~fish-completion-fallback-on-bash-p~ non-nil, fish must be installed
  for bash completion to work. This has been circumvented.
- [[rmcs-package:eshell-did-you-mean]] does not work on first invocation, so we manually invoke
  it once.

* Installation
[[id:01cffea4-3329-45e2-a892-95a384ab2338][Enable this module in your ~rmcs!~ block.]]

* TODO Usage

* TODO Configuration

** TERM name
By default, [[rmcs-package:eshell]] sets the =$TERM= variable to ~"xterm-256color"~, which helps
with rendering various colours. As eshell is /not/ a terminal emulator, these
will not always work 100%. Modifying ~eshell-term-name~ to your liking may help.
