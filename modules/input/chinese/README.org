** Maintainers
*This module needs a maintainer.* [[rmcs-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +rime ::
  Enables the [[https://rime.im/][rime]] backend for pyim.
- +childframe ::
  Display pyim candidates in a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Child-Frames.html][child frame]] rather than overlay or tooltip.

** Packages
- [[rmcs-package:ace-pinyin]]
- [[rmcs-package:chinese-wbim]] if [[rmcs-module:+wubi]]

If you want to use rime as the input method engine:
- Emacs must be built with dynamic module support, i.e. compiled with the
  =--with-modules= option.
- You need =librime= installed on your system.
- You need =make=, =cmake= and a C compiler such as =gcc= so that liberime can
  build =liberime-core.so=.
