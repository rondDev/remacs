* Description :unfold:
[[rmcs-package:treemacs][Treemacs]] is a file and project explorer similar to NeoTree or vim's NerdTree,
but largely inspired by the Project Explorer in Eclipse. It shows the file
system outlines of your projects in a simple tree layout allowing quick
navigation and exploration, while also possessing basic file management
utilities. It includes:

- Integration with Git (if [[rmcs-module::tools magit]] is enabled)
- Integration with Evil (if [[rmcs-module::editor evil +everywhere]] is enabled)
- Workspace awareness (if [[rmcs-module::ui workspaces]] is enabled)

The variable ~+treemacs-git-mode~ sets the type of git integration that treemacs
has.

There are 3 possible values:
1. ~'simple~ (the default), which highlights only files based on their git
   status, and is slightly faster,
2. ~'extended~, which highlights both files and directories, but requires
   python,
3. ~'deferred~, same as extended, but highlights asynchronously.

#+begin_quote
  ~+treemacs-git-mode~ must be set before treemacs is loaded.
