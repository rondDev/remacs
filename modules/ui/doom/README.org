* Description :unfold:
This module gives Rmcs its signature look: powered by the [[rmcs-package:rmcs-themes][rmcs-one]] theme
(loosely inspired by [[https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax][Atom's One Dark theme]]) and [[rmcs-package:solaire-mode]]. Includes:

- A custom folded-region indicator for [[rmcs-package:hideshow]].
- "Thin bar" fringe bitmaps for [[rmcs-package:git-gutter-fringe]].
- File-visiting buffers are slightly brighter (thanks to [[rmcs-package:solaire-mode]]).

** Changing theme
Although this module uses the ~rmcs-one~ theme by default, [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-rmcs-theme/][rmcs-themes]] offers a
number of alternatives:

- *rmcs-one:* rmcs-themes' flagship theme, inspired by [[https://atom.io/][Atom's]] One Dark themes
- *rmcs-vibrant:* a more vibrant version of rmcs-one
- *rmcs-molokai:* based on Textmate's monokai
- *rmcs-nova:* adapted from [[https://github.com/trevordmiller/nova-colors][Nova]]
- *rmcs-one-light:* light version of rmcs-one
- *rmcs-peacock:* based on Peacock from [[https://daylerees.github.io/][daylerees' themes]]
- *rmcs-tomorrow-night:* by [[https://github.com/ChrisKempson/Tomorrow-Theme][Chris Kempson]]
- And /many/ more...

This can be changed by changing the ~rmcs-theme~ variable, e.g.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $RMCSDIR/config.el
(setq rmcs-theme 'rmcs-molokai)
#+end_src

** Changing fonts
core/core-ui.el has four relevant variables:

- ~rmcs-font~ :: the default font to use in Rmcs Emacs.
- ~rmcs-big-font~ :: the font to use when ~rmcs-big-font-mode~ is enabled.
- ~rmcs-variable-pitch-font~ :: the font to use when ~variable-pitch-mode~ is active
  (or where the ~variable-pitch~ face is used).
- ~rmcs-symbol-font~ :: the font used to display unicode symbols. This is
  ignored if the [[rmcs-module::ui unicode]] module is enabled.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq rmcs-font (font-spec :family "Fira Mono" :size 12)
      rmcs-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans")
      rmcs-symbol-font (font-spec :family "JuliaMono")
      rmcs-big-font (font-spec :family "Fira Mono" :size 19))
#+end_src

* Troubleshooting
[[rmcs-report:][Report an issue?]]

** Strange font symbols
If you're seeing strange unicode symbols, this is likely because you don't have
~nerd-icons~'s font icon installed. You can install them with ~M-x
nerd-icons-install-fonts~.

** Ugly background colors in tty Emacs for daemon users
[[rmcs-package:solaire-mode]] is an aesthetic plugin that makes non-file-visiting buffers darker
than the rest of the Emacs' frame (to visually differentiate temporary windows
or sidebars from editing windows). This looks great in GUI Emacs, but can look
questionable in the terminal.

It disables itself if you start tty Emacs with ~$ emacs -nw~, but if you create
a tty frame from a daemon (which solaire-mode cannot anticipate), you'll get an
ugly background instead.

If you only use Emacs in the terminal, your best bet is to disable the
solaire-mode package:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $RMCSDIR/packages.el
(package! solaire-mode :disable t)
#+end_src
