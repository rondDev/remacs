/This module has no external requirements./

* Usage
Nothing more needs to be done once the module is activated. Tildes will become
visible in all buffers, after EOB.

* Configuration
By default, rmcs activates ~vi-tilde-fringe-mode~ for ~prog-mode~, ~text-mode~
and ~conf-mode~. To change this to your liking, you can remove any of the modes
from the list:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $RMCSDIR/config.el
(remove-hook 'text-mode-hook #'vi-tilde-fringe-mode)
#+end_src

Or add new modes where you would like ~vi-tilde-fringe-mode~ enabled:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; in $RMCSDIR/config.el
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'vi-tilde-fringe-mode)
#+end_src
