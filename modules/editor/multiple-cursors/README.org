** evil-mc
- The [[rmcs-package:evil-mc]] keys are under the [[kbd:][gz]] prefix, e.g.
  - [[kbd:][gzz]] to toggle new (frozen) cursors at point.
  - [[kbd:][gzt]] to toggle mirroring on and off (or switch to insert mode to activate
    them).
  - [[kbd:][gzA]] to place cursors at the end of each selected line.
  - [[kbd:][gzI]] will place them at the beginning.
- There's also the ex command ~:mc/REGEXP/FLAGS~, for laying down cursors by
  regex.

** evil-multiedit
Designates "interactive edit" regions. Only the textual changes to them are mirrored.

- [[kbd:][M-d]] to iedit the symbol at point. Again to iedit its next match.
- [[kbd:][M-S-d]] to do it backwards.
- [[kbd:][R]] (in visual mode) to iedit all matches of the selection at point in the
  buffer.
- Or ~:iedit/REGEX~ to iedit all matches of REGEX.
