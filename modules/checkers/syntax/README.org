* Description :unfold:
This module provides syntax checking and error highlighting, powered by
[[rmcs-package:flycheck]].

** Maintainers
/This module has no dedicated maintainers./ [[rmcs-contrib-maintainer:][Become a maintainer?]]

** Module flags
- +childframe ::
  Display errors/warnings in a [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Child-Frames.html][child frame]] rather than an overlay or tooltip.
  *Requires GUI Emacs.*
- +flymake :: Leverages the inbuilt [[rmcs-package:flymake]] for error and
  diagnostics highlighting.

** Packages
- [[rmcs-package:flycheck]]
- [[rmcs-package:flycheck-popup-tip]]
- [[rmcs-package:flycheck-posframe]] if [[rmcs-module:+childframe]]

** Hacks
- If ~lsp-ui-mode~ is active, most of the aesthetic functionality of this module
  is turned off, as they show the same information.

This module has no direct requirements, but some languages may have their own
requirements to fulfill before you get syntax checking in them (and some
languages may lack syntax checking support altogether). Run ~$ rmcs doctor~ to
find out if you're missing any dependencies.
