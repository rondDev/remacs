;; Welcome to the sandbox!
;;
;; This is a test bed for running Emacs Lisp in another instance of Emacs that
;; has varying amounts of Doom loaded:
;;
;; - vanilla Emacs (nothing loaded)         \[rmcs--run-vanilla-emacs]
;; - vanilla Doom (only Doom core)          \[rmcs--run-vanilla-rmcs]
;; - Doom + modules - your private config   \[rmcs--run-vanilla-rmcs+]
;; - Doom + modules + your private config   \[rmcs--run-full-rmcs]
;;
;; This is done without sacrificing access to installed packages. Use the sandbox
;; to reproduce bugs and determine if Doom is to blame.
