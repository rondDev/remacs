But before you rmcs yourself, here are some things you should know:

1. Don't forget to run 'rmcs sync', then restart Emacs, after modifying init.el
   or packages.el in ~/.config/rmcs.

   This command ensures needed packages are installed, orphaned packages are
   removed, and your autoloads/cache files are up to date. When in doubt, run
   'rmcs sync'!

2. If something goes wrong, run `rmcs doctor`. It diagnoses common issues with
   your environment and setup, and may offer clues about what is wrong.

3. Use 'rmcs upgrade' to update Doom. Doing it any other way will require
   additional steps. Run 'rmcs help upgrade' to understand those extra steps.

4. Access Doom's documentation from within Emacs via 'SPC h d h' or 'C-h d h'
   (or 'M-x rmcs/help')

Have fun!
